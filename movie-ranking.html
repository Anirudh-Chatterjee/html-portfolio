<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Fast Five</h3>

<p>
    The fifth film in the fast and furious franchise. Absolutely loved it. Everything was perfect.<br />
    The direction.<br>
    The music.<br />
    The action.<br/>
    All of it.<br/>
</p>

<h3>2. Sholay</h3>

<p>
    Bollywood classic and a timeless one at that.
</p>

<h3>3. Rush Hour 3</h3>

<p>
    Comedic gold. With Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker at the lead, this film was jam-packed with action and funny moments.
