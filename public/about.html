<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Anirudh and this is just a very simple introduction really.
  I love playing football, that's soccer to Americans and I love learning something new 
  related to computers. As you might have guessed, I am currently trying to dip my toes in web development.</p>

<p>Besides these, I enjoy listening to music and watching tv shows. I am an ambivert-ish person who likes some alone time daily
  as i feel it helps stimulate my brain.
</p>

<p>Well that's it for my introduction. I would love to contact any like-thinkers. *wink*</p>
